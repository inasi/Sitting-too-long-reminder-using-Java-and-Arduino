# Java-and-Arduino-Project-for-Programming-course
The purpose of this system is to inform a person if they have been sitting too long and to remind them to stand up in regular intervals. 
The OLED on the arduino displays a live countdown starting from 10 (as an example).
When the countdown ends, a buzzer is supposed to ring and the OLED should display "Stand up".
The buzzer can be turned off when a button on the grove board is pressed. 
A motion sensor connected to the Arduino board sends data to Java where a graph displays how many times a person stood up during the interval.
